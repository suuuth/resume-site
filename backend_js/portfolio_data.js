This application utilizes a RESTful API which is written in Php using the Laravel framework.  Laravel comes with a few more tools, including Compass (Command line tool for compiling Sass files) as well as Blade for templating.  Prior to working on this, I had never used Larvel or Php.  I learned both of these skills on-the-job as I worked with the help of my co-workers at Matrix, StackExchange, and the Laravel Docs.  This project also features JQuery and JQuery-UI, heavy use of Ajax, and Sass.',

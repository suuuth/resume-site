         application that functions as a digital respository for Matrix\'s clients to use for
         data management.  This application utilizes a RESTful API which is written in PHP using
         Laravel.  On this project, we utilized Compass, SASS, and Blade for templating.  Prior
         to working on this, I had never worked with Larvel or wrote any PHP.  I learned both of
         these skills on-the-job by teaching myself through trial-and-error troubleshooting, by
         asking my co-workers questions, and by google searching just about everything.
         StackExchange, the Laravel Documentation, PHP manual pages, MDN, and CSS tricks became
         my best friends.  Aside from PHP, SASS, and Blade, this project also invloved heavy
         use of JQuery, JQuery-UI, and Ajax.`,
